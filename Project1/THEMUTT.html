      Sometimes, I see myself as a dog. Much like a dog I am loyal and
      caring, but also on the lookout for opportunity. I've spent a lot of
      time among other mutts growing up in West Terre Haute, Indiana. I’ve
      always had a love for nature and spending as much time as I can in it.
      I am in touch with my wolf side, getting far away from modern society
      and reverting to the ways of cavemen, or even apes. The concrete
      jungle is no place for Joe, that’s for sure.

      I graduated from West Vigo High School in 2017 and then took the
      unusual path of working several different physically-demanding and
      mentally-taxing jobs instead of continuing my education. These jobs
      caused me a great deal of stress, which, when coupled with the lack of
      clear direction I had for my life, led to me spending more and more
      time outside away from the world I found myself in. This time spent in
      the woods gave me some sense of direction, pointing me west to
      Colorado, where I could really immerse myself in nature. There’s
      really nothing in Terre Haute that can compare to the feeling of
      waking up everyday in the Rocky Mountains. Eventually, this desire to
      find peace and purpose transformed into a resolve to return to Indiana
      and finish my degree.

      Outside of school, I enjoy skating, playing guitar, painting, and
      spending time with my friends and my girlfriend. I have interest in
      fashion, interior design, theater, and various other artistic
      endeavors. After I graduate, I hope to get a job where I can improve
      the lives of others and spend my time outside of an office. Most
      importantly, I hope to find a way to continue to be in touch with
      nature and show others how powerful it can be to find that escape from
      the day-to-day grind.
